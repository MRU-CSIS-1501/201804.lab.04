# Lab-04

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Time to up your game in Emacs!

Your instructor will show you some useful features of Emacs - feel free to follow along!

There will also be a number of tweaks you can make to your .emacs file written below that you might find useful.

## SOME USEFUL .emacs MODS

To do any of these, you need to edit the `.emacs` file that is in your home directory. When you are done editing that file, save your work, and exit from Emacs. From that point onward, Emacs will use your mods!

### LINE NUMBERS

### COLUMN MARKER

### TRAILING SPACE REMOVER

### TABS TO SPACES
